Welcome! This project provides:

- **Curated guides**: Step-by-step instructions for installing popular applications using their official Helm charts in a Kubernetes cluster.
- **Custom Helm charts**: A collection of charts that were created for deploying unique workloads on Kubernetes.

Whether you're deploying custom solutions or setting up well-known applications like NGINX or Prometheus, this repository aims to simplify your Kubernetes journey with tested configurations and clear documentation.

## Usage

### From Helm CLI

```bash
# checks helm is installed
helm version

# if not already done, adds devpro repository in helm
helm repo add devpro https://devpro.github.io/helm-charts

# refreshes helm repository informations
helm repo update

# searches for a specific package from the command line
helm search repo -l <package_name>

# installs a package
helm install <package_name>
```

### From ArgoCD

* Create a git repository to store Kubernetes definition files (GitOps approach)

```yaml
# wordpress/Chart.yaml
apiVersion: v2
name: wordpress
description: Helm chart for installing WordPress
type: application
version: 0.1.0
appVersion: 1.0.0
dependencies:
  - name: wordpress
    version: 0.1.1
    repository: https://devpro.github.io/helm-charts
```

* Create a new application in ArgoCD to reference the git repository with the path to the folder

### From Fleet

* Create a git repository to store Kubernetes definition files (GitOps approach)

```yaml
# wordpress/fleet.yaml
defaultNamespace: sample-apps
helm:
  repo: https://devpro.github.io/helm-charts
  chart: wordpress
  version: 0.1.1
  releaseName: wordpress
```
